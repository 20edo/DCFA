This simple program was developed during the 2019-2020 (during coronavirus pandemy) A.A as an assignement for the course of Dynamics and Control of Flexible Aircraft held by Pierangelo Masarati. 
The contributors are five students.
The goal of the assignement is to perform some aeroelastic analysis of a swept wing aircraft, our goal is to write a suite that can be easily extended to other engineering problems.
